Is type(5) == int always True? Is isinstance(5, int) always True? Explain the difference.
->type(5)
Checks for exact type match.
Returns True only if the object is exactly of type int.
->isinstance(5,int)
Checks if the object is an instance of a class or its subclasses.
More flexible and robust.
