'''Lost & Found in the Supermarket
You’re managing the stock system for a small supermarket. Each item is a key, and its count is the value. 
A frantic customer wants to know if “apples” are still available. How will you instantly check if “apples” are on your shelf?
Input: stock = {'apples': 14, 'bananas': 22, 'rice': 12}, query = 'apples'
Expected Output: Yes, apples are in stock!'''

import ast
stock=input("Enter the stock details:")
stock=ast.literal_eval(stock)

query=input("Enter the item to check its stock availability:")

if query in stock.keys():
    print(f"Yes, {query} are in stock!")
else:
    print("out of stock!")
